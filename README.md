# LIFE4136 Rotation 1 Group 3
Welcome to the Github Repository dedicated to Rotation 1 of LIFE4136: Bioinformatics Group Research Project, of the MSc Bioinformatics at University of Nottingham 2023/2024. This respository provides a comprehensive suite of scripts designed for the assembly and analysis of genomic data derived from both short-read (Illumina) and long-read (Nanopore) sequencing technologies. Our pipeline is crafted to support detailed exploration and modification of microbial genomes, making it possible to identify genetic modifications across various strains. Below you will find detailed instructions on how to deploy and utilize our pipeline, including descriptions of each script, their inputs and outputs, and the order in which to run them for optimal results.
